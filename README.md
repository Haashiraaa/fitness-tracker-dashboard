🏋🏽‍♂️ Fitness Tracker Dashboard

📊 Overview

The Fitness Tracker Dashboard is a professional data visualization project built with Matplotlib.
It visualizes daily fitness statistics such as calories burned, workout duration, and intensity, combining multiple chart types into one clean, presentation-ready dashboard.

This project explores how visual design, color balance, and chart composition can make raw health data more intuitive and insightful.

📱 Display Note

For the best viewing experience, it’s recommended to run this visualization in landscape mode or on a device with a wider screen.

On some mobile devices (such as when using PyDroid in portrait orientation), the visualized charts may appear compressed or overlapped due to limited vertical space.

To ensure proper layout and clear chart separation:

Rotate your device to landscape view, or

Run the script in an environment that supports wider aspect ratios (e.g., PC, tablet, or saved image preview).


When using Termux, saved plots automatically open in landscape view by default, providing accurate visualization.

🏆 Author’s Note

This project was built as a capstone challenge after completing Chapter 15 – Data Visualization from Python Crash Course, 3rd Edition.

It reflects practical experimentation with data storytelling, design consistency, and professional visualization techniques — combining the technical precision of Matplotlib with the aesthetics of real-world dashboards.
