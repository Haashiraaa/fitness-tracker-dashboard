🏋🏽‍♂️ Fitness Tracker Dashboard

Overview

The Fitness Tracker Dashboard is a professional data visualization project built with Matplotlib.
It visualizes daily fitness statistics such as calories burned, workout duration, and intensity, combining multiple chart types into one clean, presentation-ready dashboard.

This project explores how visual design, color balance, and chart composition can make raw health data more intuitive and insightful.

## Skills Demonstrated

Advanced Matplotlib Styling: Customized colors, font sizes, gridlines, and figure spacing for a cohesive layout.

Dashboard Composition: Combined multiple plots (bar, line, pie) into a single visual story.

Visual Design Thinking: Focused on readability, visual balance, and professional presentation.

## Key Features

Multi-plot dashboard simulating a real-world fitness tracker report.

Personalized fonts, colors, and layout spacing for a clean and modern aesthetic.

Built to mirror presentation-level visuals that could be used in health apps or analytics reports.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Haashiraaa/fitness-tracker-dashboard.git


2. Open the script in your preferred Python environment.


3. Run the script:

python fitness_dashboard.py


4. The visualization will display automatically using plt.show().

## Display Note

For the best viewing experience, it’s recommended to run this visualization in landscape mode or on a device with a wider screen.

On some mobile devices (such as when using PyDroid in portrait orientation), the visualized charts may appear compressed or overlapped due to limited vertical space.

To ensure proper layout and clear chart separation:

Rotate your device to landscape view, or

Run the script in an environment that supports wider aspect ratios (e.g., PC, tablet, or saved image preview).


When using Termux, saved plots automatically open in landscape view by default, providing accurate visualization.

## Author’s Note

This project was built as a capstone challenge after completing Chapter 15 – Data Visualization from Python Crash Course, 3rd Edition.

It reflects practical experimentation with data storytelling, design consistency, and professional visualization techniques — combining the technical precision of Matplotlib with the aesthetics of real-world dashboards.
